## `beepy-kbd` firmware check

The keyboard and firmware driver package will run a preinstall check to ensure that the Beepy firmware is compatible with the driver.

If the installed firmware is detected as incompatible, the installation will be canceled.

A link to a compatible firmware release will be output as part of the error message.

## Cleaning old drivers

The `bbqX0kbd` driver has been renamed to `beepy-kbd`, and `sharp` to `sharp-drm`.

Driver packages will detect if one of these old modules is installed and cancel installation of the package.

Remove the following files:

* `/lib/modules/<uname>/extra/bbqX0kbd.ko*`
* `/lib/modules/<uname>/extra/sharp.ko*`
* `/boot/overlays/i2c-bbqX0kbd.dtbo`
* `/boot/overlays/sharp.dtbo`

Rebuild the module list:

* `depmod -a`

Remove the following lines from `/boot/config.txt`:

* `dtoverlay=bbqX0kbd,irq_pin=4`
* `dtoverlay=sharp`

Remove the following lines from `/etc/modules`:

* `bbqX0kbd`
* `sharp`
